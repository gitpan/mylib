NAME
    mylib - add private lib to the module search path

DESCRIPTION
    This is just a convenient wrapper around FindBin and lib that will
    prepend to perl's search path the lib directory either found in the
    directory of the script or its parent directory. If neither of these
    locations contain a lib directory it will die.

    This makes it easy to create a collection of scripts that share private
    modules (not to be installed with perl) using the traditional Unix
    layout of sibling bin, lib, man, etc,... directories.
