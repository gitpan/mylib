NAME
    mylib - add private lib to the module search path

DESCRIPTION
    This is just a convenient wrapper around FindBin and lib that will
    prepend the lib directory either found in the directory of the script or
    its parent directory. If neither of these locations contain a lib
    directory it will die.
